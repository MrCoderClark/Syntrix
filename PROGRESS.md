# Progress

Track build progress through Syntrix. Update this file as sections complete
(after merge to `main`). Claude reads this to understand where the project is.

## Current state — read this first

> **Phase 2 is complete.** Phase 3 (Real-time Chat) is **in design**.
> Phase 3 has 4 subsystems; Subsystem 1 (WS Gateway & Presence) spec is approved.
>
> **Current branch:** `main`
> **Next action:** write implementation plan for Phase 3, Subsystem 1.

## Convention
- `[ ]` = Not started
